								<b>JWST LEGGOS</b><br> As it turns out, strongly-lensed galaxies act as an excellent magnifying glass 
								for early universe star forming clumps. Observing and manually tagging clumps is tedious and prone to error. 
								By automating this process, we can focus our analysis on these clumps, elucidating information about the metallicity, 
								stellar masses, and star formation histories of high-redshift galaxies. 
								My research is focused on developing a software pipeline for dimension reduction using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to 
								automatically identify and group together these star forming clumps from JWST/NIRCam imagery. The pipeline will take in FITS files of lensed 
								galaxies, reduce the data to 2 or 3 dimensions, and output a topological map that distinguishes star forming regions from non star forming regions. 
								By automating this process with UMAP, the typically error-prone and difficult task of manually identifying and tagging clumps is avoided. 
								Isolating these star-forming regions prepares them to be analyzed for other parameters such as metallicity, dust content, and stellar mass distribution, 
								ultimately leading to an increase in our understanding of the physics of early universe star formation and galactic dynamics.
