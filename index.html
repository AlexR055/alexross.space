								<b>JWST LEGGOS</b><br> Strong gravitational lensing provides a natural magnifying effect, 
								allowing for detailed studies of high-redshift star-forming clusters. While there have been studies on the 
								physical properties of these clumps in strongly lensed galaxies, there is a distinct lack of software to automatically 
								identify and analyze regions of stellar formation. Typical methods of clump identification rely on contrast enhancement 
								through image smoothing and subtraction, followed by the use of visual and automatic source detection software. 
								While generally effective, these approaches require careful parameter tuning and manual validation, 
								limiting their efficiency and reproducibility. These methods also suffer from inaccuracies due to contamination from the 
								diffuse host galaxy, bright neighboring sources, and intracluster light. We present a novel software pipeline titled SUMAC 
								(Software for Uniform Manifold Approximation of Clusters) that automatically processes FITS files of lensed galaxies, reduces 
								the data using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and outputs a topological map clustering together pixels with 
								similar characteristics. Users can specify parameters of interest, including flux, spectral energy distribution, and morphology. 
								We utilize JWST/NIRCam imagery of the z =2.481 lensed galaxy SGAS1110, confirming the functionality of SUMAC by automatically 
								tagging points in the UMAP topological space, mapping them back to the imagery of the lensed galaxy to show alignment with 
								visual star forming clusters. We additionally analyze spectroscopic data for the galaxy, ensuring pixels that SUMAC identifies as 
								corresponding to star-forming clumps match characteristics such as age, metallicity, and emission line ratios that are 
								indicative of stellar formation. SUMACâ€™s ability to handle large datasets efficiently, without requiring manual 
								validation or extensive parameter tuning, ensures a more reproducible and scalable approach to high-redshift galactic 
								analysis. SUMAC represents a significant advancement in the field of astronomical image processing, offering a powerful 
								tool for studying early universe galactic dynamics.
